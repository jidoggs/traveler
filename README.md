# Traveler

Stutern milestone project to build a Travel application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features
Users are able to key in location in a search bar to get 

- Weather forecast
- Travel advice/news
- Recreation centers

## Expected Technologies

1. I Research and got multiple APIs that returns payload that suits the app requirement 
2. I used [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)  and  any SCSS.


## Design
Traveller was designed in 2 days by [Biola](https://www.behance.net/qudirahnurudeen) . [Screens](https://www.figma.com/file/9CgkBsbe6qA5M7KdhXpxsK/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) because i had a development deadline to meet.
